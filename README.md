# Logistic Regression

To apply / test my knowledge of logistic regression, backpropogation, and gradient descent I decided to implement a binary classifier using only numpy. This notebook:

1. Creates a generic dataset, splitting and labelling the data
2. Defines a forward and backwards pass, as well as a cost (and loss) function for logistic regression
3. Visualizes the predictions and calculates their accuracy
